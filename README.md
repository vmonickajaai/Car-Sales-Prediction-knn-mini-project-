🚗 Car Sales Prediction 
This mini-project demonstrates the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predicting car sales data. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation. Ideal for beginners learning supervised machine learning with real-world data.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict car sales values based on customer and vehicle features using the KNN algorithm.

Model Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (Regression)

Tools & Libraries: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes fields like:

Customer Name

Customer Email

Country

Gender

Age

Annual Salary

Credit Card Debt

Net Worth

Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable)

📄 Dataset Source: Car_Purchasing_Data.csv (included in repo)

🧪 Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🧠 ML Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Drop unnecessary fields (e.g., name, email)

Convert categorical data if necessary

Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

Model Training

Split into training and testing sets

Use KNeighborsRegressor from scikit-learn

Choose optimal k value

Model Evaluation

Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

Visualize predictions vs actual values

🚀 How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car-Sales-Prediction-knn-mini-project.git

# Step 2: Navigate into the directory
cd Car-Sales-Prediction-knn-mini-project

# Step 3: Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Run the Jupyter notebook or script
jupyter notebook Car_Sales_KNN.ipynb
📊 Sample Output
A plot comparing predicted vs actual car purchase amounts.

R² score and MSE printed for performance evaluation.

✅ Results
The KNN model performs reasonably well on scaled numeric data.

With proper tuning of k value and feature selection, prediction accuracy can be improved.

📌 Future Improvements
Try different ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Hyperparameter tuning

Implement GUI or Web interface
